Title: Longest Harmonious Subsequence
*/
/*
# Attempt 2:

I can pre-calculate the number of occurrences for every unique number in nums in O(n)
After that, for each unique number, I can check if there are > 0 ocurrences of "number + 1" and "number - 1" also O(n) on the worst case (all numbers in num are unique)
Then, if there are > 0 occurrences, keep the greatest sum of occurrences between (num and num + 1) and (num and num - 1)

For it to work, I'll need a map of unique numbers to number of occurrences and a list of unique numbers - O(n)
Is it possible to extract the list of key from a map? Does not look like there is a standard way.
So I'll probably need a set of numbers - O(n)

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)

# Brute force attempt:

for each number in nums, scan every number after them counting the occurrences of:
    - nums[i] and nums[i] - 1 
    - nums[i] and nums[i] + 1
then, keep the largest number of occurrences
Time: O(nÂ²)
Space: O(1)
